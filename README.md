# Crypto_project

Through this project I aim at explaining few concepts about cryptography I have learnt along the way. 


## Project Details

Me and my friend have been asked to code a Bullettin Board System: a place where users register, login and post what they are thinking; the hard part is the security requirements 
the project has to fullfil.

+ Never store or transmit passwords in the clear.
+ Fulfill confidentiality, integrity, no-replay, and non-malleability in communications.
+ Guarantee perfect forward secrecy (PFS).

Seems fun, let's start.
